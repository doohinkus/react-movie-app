## Moni's Movie App
### A movie search app that I wrote for the Sandy Public Library. The library has license agreements with a handful of studios. This app provides a way for librarians to browse movies that were produced by the studios covered in the library's contract.

### I build this app with React JS and Bootstrap 4. I deployed on Surge. I have also created another version of the app using Flask and JQuery.

### The app does require an API key from [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

## Requirements:
* node
* npm
* The Movie DB API key

### Directions
* Clone & cd into repo
* Create this file name api.key.js in the "src" directory /src/api.key
```javascript
key="<insert-your-api-key>"
```
* Install dependencies:
```node
npm install
```
* Run:
```node
npm run
```
* Open browser to http://localhost:3000 -- this should launch automatically
